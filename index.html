      <p>I am a software engineer living in Tampa, Florida. I came to Thinkful for a change of career after being furloughed from my job as an esthetician. I became non-essential very quickly and vowed to become recession-proof. I am dedicated to adding to my skills constantly now and exploring the interest and fascination I've always held for computers and the wonders of the internet.

      <!-- Segmenting my text to say a little bit about myself, and a little more about my plans with schooling.--> 
      <p>I am really excited to learn about software developing and learn even more from the Thinkful community. I have already found good support in our Slack communities during the Prep Course. I've been learning through other forums and coding resources, so I can see how eager to help a lot of other people are in this field and feels welcoming. I want to one day build my own websites, apps and projects from the ground up with my own ideas and even help others to help make their visions come to life.</p>

     <p>In addition to my passion for self-care from my spa background, I also have become a business owner in the last two years. The crafting and art involved in running my business have quickly taken up more of my time. In running online platforms for my business, I realized how important a neat and intriguing web presence is. I hope my Thinkful education can maximize my business efforts by making something that fully represents me and my brand.</p>

      <p>In my downtime, I enjoy cooking, tweeting and listening to music. I love reading and learning about business and money and I see myself as an entrepeneur, if something I want doesn't exist, I will find a way to make it.</p>
