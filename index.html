      <p>I'm a California native living in Florida.<br><br>
      <!-- Segmenting my text to say a little bit about myself, and a little more about my plans with schooling.--> 
      I am really excited to learn about software developing and learn even more from the Thinkful community. I have already found good support in our Slack communities during the Prep Course. I've been learning through other forums and coding resources, so I can see how eager to help a lot of other people are in this field and feels welcoming. I want to one day build my own websites, apps and projects from the ground up with my own ideas and even help others to help make their visions come to life.</p>

      </ul>
    
      <p>and have a desire to learn as much as I can in this program. I have an ecommerce store that I run on two different platforms. I'm passionate about blending what I learn from Thinkful to add to my current business.</p></main>
